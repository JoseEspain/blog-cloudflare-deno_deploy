## Purpose

- Document my life and learning journey for review and sharingðŸ˜Š.

### Displaying Mathematical Formulas

- Duhamel's integral method for single-degree-of-freedom vibration
- Duhamel Integration Method
- Calculation method:
    - Cut the earthquake motion (external load) time history into small segments of impulse loads with different peak values.
    - Under the action of each segment of impulse load, the structure performs damped free vibration (a sine curve that gradually decreases).
    - Sum the responses (free vibration responses) under the action of each segment of impulse load to obtain the final displacement time history.
- Formula
    - At time $t=\tau$, the displacement generated by the impulse $I=F\cdot\Delta t$ is calculated according to the following formula:

$$
\nu(t)=\frac{I}{m \omega_{n}} e^{-\xi \omega_{n}(t-\tau)} \sin \left(\omega_{n}(t-\tau)\right)
$$
- 
    - $\omega_{n}$ is the natural circular frequency of the structure with a single mass $m$,
    - $T_n$ is the natural period of the structure,
    - $k$ is the stiffness of the structure,
    - $\xi$ is the damping coefficient
$$
\omega_{n}={\frac{2\pi}{T_{n}}} ={\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}
$$

|Environment Variable|Function|
|---|---|
|**PYMAPDL_START_INSTANCE**|Overrides the behavior of the `ansys.mapdl.core.launcher.launch_mapdl()` function, only attempting to connect to an existing instance of PyMAPDL. Generally used in conjunction with `PYMAPDL_PORT`.|
|**PYMAPDL_PORT**|The default port for PyMAPDL to connect to.|
|**PYMAPDL_IP**|The default IP for PyMAPDL to connect to.|
|**ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE**|The license file or IP address in the format `PORT@IP`. Do not confuse this with the `IP` and `PORT` where the MAPDL instance is running, which are specified using `PYMAPDL_IP` and `PYMAPDL_PORT`. This helps provide licensing for Docker.|
|**PYMAPDL_MAPDL_EXEC**|The executable path to start the MAPDL instance.|
|**PYMAPDL_MAPDL_VERSION**|The default MAPDL version to start when multiple MAPDL versions are available.|
|**PYMAPDL_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH**|The maximum length of a gRPC message. Increase this value if your connection terminates when running PRNSOL or NLIST. In bytes, defaults to 256 MB.|

### Text Formatting

- `**Bold**`   -> **Bold**
- `_Italic_`  -> *Italic*
- `~~Strikethrough~~` -> ~~Strikethrough~~
